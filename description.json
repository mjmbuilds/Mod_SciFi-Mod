   "description" : "Recent Updates:\n-Fix some bugs with seats/logic.\n-Fix old code in lasers/missiles so they detect players/seats correctly.\n-New \"Seat ReExiter Teleporter\" part. Connect a seat to it and you will teleport to its location upon esit. I made it to avoid getting stuck in the roof in small vehicles, but it's basically a teleporter.\n-Seat Logic reader new modes: left/right mouse click, scroll up/down, and space (space doesn't exit seat when being detected as logic). \n-Seat Logic reader now has GUI for selecting modes.\n-Seats have survival seat bearing control. Also space bar is disabled form jumping out of seat.\n-Tank Engine/Tracks work with survival seats.\n\nTODO - up next:\n-Rework the \"Gravity Core\" and \"Inertia Drive\" scripts and add them back in.\n-Add GUI to things with speed/thrust/etc so they are easier to use.\n",
